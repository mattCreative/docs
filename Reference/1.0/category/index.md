# Categories

Categories are [flows](flow) based data structures that can be organised into parent and child relationships to create a tree structure. This allows categories to not only group [products](product) but to also act as a navigation source.

Categories have a basic data structure containing only the most necessary information; however this can be extended via [flows](flow). This additional data allows you to customise the category to meet the needs of your project, and will automatically be added to your forge instance for ease of use.
