# API Reference Introduction

Welcome to the Moltin API reference. The Moltin API is organized around REST and is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.

We're working as fast as we can to give you complete coverage of the API as we build and introduce new features.

#### Example Responses
``` json

As you navigate the API reference example responses will be shown here for each endpoint. If you're logged in we'll even return relevant data for your store instead of dummy data!
