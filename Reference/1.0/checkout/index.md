# Checkout

The checkout process allows you to turn a users cart into an order, passing in billing and shipping [addresses](../address), a [customer](../customer), a [shipping](../shipping) method and a [payment](../gateway) gateway. From there you can then process a payment for the order by passing through their credit card details or redirecting to an external gateway.
