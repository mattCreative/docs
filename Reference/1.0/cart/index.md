# Carts

The cart allows users to register their interest in items and store them to be bought now or later. The cart system can have normal [products](../product), [variations](../variation) and custom items added to it, all data added to a cart is stored and available whenever it or an [order](../order) is retrieved.

The cart identifier can be any unique string, our SDKs generate a single cart identifier for each user.
