# Entries

Entries are rows of data stored in a [flow](../flow) and can be everything from a product to a customer. Each of these items can be customised via the forge dashboard or directly via the api itself.

> **Note:** Entries are custom to their flow and each object will be different, however each will contain an id, order, created_at, and updated_at value.
