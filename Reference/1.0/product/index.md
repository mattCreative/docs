# Products

Products are [flows](../flow) based data structures that store information relating to your inventory. These items can be added to your [cart](../cart) and then sold using the [checkout](../checkout) endpoints, specific items can also be set to catalog only to be used for display purposes only.

Products can be added to multiple hierarchical [categories](../category), and grouped by [collection](../collection) and [brand](../brand).

Products are able to support sizes, colours, etc. using the [modifier](../modifier) and [variation](../variation) system, which turns the parent product into a container and only allows the children to be sold. These child products can be totally customised using sku, title, price, stock levels, description and images.
