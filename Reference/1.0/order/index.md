# Orders

Orders are [flows](../flow) based data structures.

Orders has a basic data structure containing only the most necessary information; however this can be extended via [flows](../flow). This additional data allows you to customise order to meet the needs of your project, and will automatically be added to your forge dashboard for ease of use.
