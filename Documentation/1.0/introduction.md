## Philosophy

eCommerce continues to grow, yet the way online stores are created hasn’t changed in years. Traditional platforms require specialised developers and result in thousands of un-billable hours through ongoing support and maintenance. Existing cloud solutions greatly limit the flexibility afforded to the developer.

Born from the frustrations of searching high and low for an eCommerce platform that worked for both ourselves and our clients, we decided enough was enough, it was down to us to take control of the situation. 

Created for developers by developers, we’ve removed the shackles of the legacy systems, we let you build whatever you want, however you want to build it. We provide a modern REST API that allows you to add a wide range of eCommerce features into any website or application. Rapidly make API calls and bind returned data to display to your customers.

This approach brings the benefits of a traditional downloaded platforms and cloud based solutions whilst avoiding many drawbacks. We're able to maintain integrations with third parties and keep your store running. You can forget about everything else, we handle database and eCommerce logic so you can concentrate on building great customer experiences.
