- [Development Tools](tools)
- [Authentication](authentication)
- [Making a call](making-a-call)
- [Configuration](configuration)
- [Requests & Input](requests-and-input)
- [Responses](responses)
- [Errors & Logging](errors-and-logging)

## Philosophy

eCommerce continues to grow, yet the way online stores are created hasn’t changed in years. Traditional platforms require specialised developers and result in thousands of un-billable hours through ongoing support and maintenance. Existing cloud solutions greatly limit the flexibility afforded to the developer.

Born from the frustrations of searching high and low for an eCommerce platform that worked for both ourselves and our clients, we decided enough was enough, it was down to us to take control of the situation. 

Created for developers by developers, we’ve removed the shackles of the out-dated systems supplied by the big boys saddled with their status quo ethos. We let you build whatever you want, however you want to build it. Our agile API will simply mould around it.
